## Monte Carlo Method: This is a technique for solving problems by generating random numbers and using statistical analysis to estimate a solution. It is used in a wide range of fields, including physics, finance, and computer science.

## Randomized Algorithms: These are algorithms that use random numbers to make decisions and produce results that are probabilistically correct. Examples include quicksort, which uses random pivots to sort arrays, and the Miller-Rabin primality test, which uses random numbers to test if a number is prime.

## Simulated Annealing: This is a metaheuristic algorithm that uses random numbers to search for the global optimum of a function. It is inspired by the physical process of annealing, where a material is heated and cooled to achieve a desired crystalline structure.

## Genetic Algorithms: These are optimization algorithms that mimic the process of natural selection to find optimal solutions to problems. They use random numbers to generate populations of potential solutions and evolve them over time through a process of selection, recombination, and mutation.
