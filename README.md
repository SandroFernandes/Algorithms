## Introduction

In the realm of software development, where change is the only constant,
I have found my home for the past 30 years. As a self-employed entrepreneur,
I've navigated the tumultuous seas of technology, always finding a way to stay
afloat and thrive.

This book is a testament to that journey, a chronicle of passion and perseverance, and a guide to extracting the maximum
potential from your machine.

My fascination with the intricacies of mathematics, particularly the enigmatic allure of mathematical constants like Pi,
has been a driving force in my career. It has led me down the path of data structures and algorithms, always in pursuit
of that elusive optimal solution. This book is a distillation of that lifelong quest, an exploration of how to speed up
algorithms and optimize performance to get the most out of your hardware.

But this book is not just about cold, hard code. It's about the human element of software development. As a teacher,
trainer, and mentor, I've always believed in the power of sharing knowledge. I've seen firsthand how the right guidance
can light up a path that once seemed shrouded in darkness. This book is my attempt to shine that light for others, to
share the insights I've gleaned from decades in the trenches of software development.

I am a solution finder, a relentless optimist who never gives up, no matter how daunting the challenge. This tenacity, I
believe, is a trait shared by the best in our field. We are the 3% of the working force who dare to dream, to innovate,
to push the boundaries of what's possible.

Above all, I am a proud father and grandfather. The lessons I've learned in my personal life have deeply influenced my
professional journey, and vice versa. This book is a reflection of that symbiosis, a narrative that intertwines code and
kinship, algorithms and affection.

In the pages that follow, I invite you to join me on this journey. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a novice just
starting out, I hope that my experiences and insights will inspire you, challenge you, and help you see the world of
software development through a new lens.

## About this book

This project started as a series of scripts to statisfy my curiosity about some
fascinating topics in computer science.

I will try to keep the code as simple as possible, so it can be used as a
reference for beginner, intermediate, advanced programmers, and useful enough to be used in
real world applications.

I'm a visual person, I understand things better when I can see them, so I will
try to include as many visualizations as possible.

I will try to keep the text as simple as possible, without too much jargon, so
it can be understood by anyone.
