ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) are useful in a variety of ways. Here are some examples:
Code analysis: ASTs can be used to analyze code and check for syntax errors, identify security vulnerabilities, and perform program transformations (such as refactoring).
Code generation: ASTs can be used to generate code for a variety of purposes, such as code translation or optimization.
Program understanding: ASTs provide a structured representation of code that can be easier to understand than raw source code. This can be especially useful for large or complex codebases.
Compilers and interpreters: ASTs are commonly used in the compilation and interpretation of programming languages. They provide a data structure that can be used by these tools to execute programs or generate machine code.
Overall, ASTs are a fundamental concept in programming language design and implementation. They provide a powerful
mechanism for parsing, analyzing, and transforming code, and are used in a wide range of applications and tools.
