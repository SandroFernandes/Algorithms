# Algorithmic complexity
Also known as time complexity or space complexity,
refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of computational
resources (time and space) used by an algorithm as a function of the size of 
the input to the program. 
It is a concept in theoretical computer science and is used to understand the 
efficiency of an algorithm, i.e., how its performance scales based on the size of the input.
The Big O notation is commonly used to express this type of complexity.


# constant time  O(1)

# linear time O(n)

# quadratic time O(n^2)

# cubic time O(n^3)

# logarithmic time O(log n)

# linearithmic time O(n log n)

# polynomial time O(n^c)

# exponential time O(c^n)

# factorial time O(n!)
