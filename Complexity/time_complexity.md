# base on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms
# make and example of each time complexity with graphs and maybe a table comparing them
# by number of operations and time
# could be a good  base for an article


# constant time  O(1)

# linear time O(n)

# quadratic time O(n^2)

# cubic time O(n^3)

# logarithmic time O(log n)

# linearithmic time O(n log n)

# polynomial time O(n^c)

# exponential time O(c^n)

# factorial time O(n!)
